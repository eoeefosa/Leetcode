What is the HTML DOM?
The HTML DOM is a standard object model and programming interface for HTML. It defines:

The HTML elements as objects
The properties of all HTML elements
The methods to access all HTML elements
The events for all HTML elements

In other words: The HTML DOM is a standard for how to get, change, add, or delete HTML elements

HTML DOM methods are actions you can perform (on HTML Elements).

HTML DOM properties are values (of HTML Elements) that you can set or change

The HTML DOM can be accessed with JavaScript (and with other programming languages).
