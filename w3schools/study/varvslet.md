Variables created with `let` do not have function scope; instead, they have block scope. This means that variables declared with `let` are only accessible within the block, statement, or expression in which they are used, not beyond that.

Here’s a brief explanation of the different scopes:

### Block Scope

- **`let`** and **`const`**: Variables declared with `let` and `const` are block-scoped. They are confined to the block (denoted by `{}`) in which they are declared.

### Function Scope

- **`var`**: Variables declared with `var` have function scope, meaning they are accessible throughout the entire function in which they are declared, regardless of block boundaries within that function.

### Examples

#### Block Scope with `let`

```javascript
{
  let x = 10;
  console.log(x); // 10
}
console.log(x); // ReferenceError: x is not defined
```

In this example, `x` is only accessible within the block where it is defined. Outside of the block, `x` is not defined.

#### Function Scope with `var`

```javascript
function example() {
  var y = 20;
  if (true) {
    var y = 30; // same variable as above
    console.log(y); // 30
  }
  console.log(y); // 30
}
example();
console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not defined
```

In this example, `y` is accessible throughout the entire function `example` because `var` is function-scoped.

#### Block Scope with `let` inside a function

```javascript
function example() {
  let z = 40;
  if (true) {
    let z = 50; // different variable from the one above
    console.log(z); // 50
  }
  console.log(z); // 40
}
example();
```

In this example, the `let` declaration inside the `if` block is scoped to that block. The outer `let` declaration remains unchanged.

### Summary

- **`let` and `const`** are block-scoped.
- **`var`** is function-scoped.Variables created with `let` do not have function scope; instead, they have block scope. This means that variables declared with `let` are only accessible within the block, statement, or expression in which they are used, not beyond that.
